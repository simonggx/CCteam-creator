[English](./README.md) | [中文](./README_CN.md)

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

CCteam-creator is built upon outstanding open-source projects and engineering practices:

| Source | What We Learned |
|--------|-----------------|
| [**planning-with-files**](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files) | Manus-style persistent markdown planning — the 3-file pattern (task_plan.md / findings.md / progress.md) that survives context compression. The "context window = RAM, file system = disk" philosophy. |
| [**everything-claude-code**](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | Agent harness optimization by Anthropic hackathon winner. 13 expert agents, 40+ skills. Inspired our role-based agent design and skill structure. |
| [**mattpocock/skills**](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) | TDD vertical-slice philosophy, "design it twice" parallel sub-agent pattern, interface durability principles, and plan stress-testing methodology. |
| [**OpenAI Harness Engineering**](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) | The discipline of designing constraints, feedback loops, and documentation systems that make AI agents reliable at scale. Inspired our docs/ knowledge base, invariant-driven review, Doc-Code Sync, failure-to-guardrail loop, and anti-bloat principles. |

## What It Does

CCteam-creator sets up parallel AI agent teams in CodeBuddy. Instead of a single AI assistant, you orchestrate multiple specialized agents — developers, researchers, testers, reviewers — working together on your project.

When invoked, CCteam-creator:

1. **Consults with you** — explains how agent teams work, understands your project, recommends a team
2. **Sets up everything** — planning files, docs/ knowledge base, CODEBUDDY.md operations guide, agent onboarding
3. **Manages collaboration** — agents communicate directly, persist state to files, follow built-in protocols

## In Action

### 1. Team Roster & Dependency Chain

After setup, team-lead summarizes the team roster, task assignments, and dependency graph. All agents receive their onboarding and begin preparing.

### 2. Parallel Task Dispatch

Team-lead orchestrates 6 agents simultaneously — researcher and cleaner start immediately (no dependencies), while devs prepare and wait for research output. Each agent knows its dependencies.

### 3. Development Phase — 3 Agents Working in Parallel

Backend-dev, frontend-dev, and e2e-tester all working concurrently. Team-lead tracks status, makes scheduling decisions (e.g., bypassing a dependency when enough info is available), and coordinates handoffs.

### 4. Code Review & Peer Coordination

Agents communicate directly — frontend-dev submits to reviewer, reviewer reports completion, team-lead tracks the status table with real-time progress from all 6 agents.

### 5. Phase Harness Validation

Team-lead runs a phase-level harness check — verifying each task's completion status, reviewer verdicts, e2e test results, and doc consistency before advancing to the next phase.

## Prerequisites

Agent teams are an experimental feature in CodeBuddy. Enable them first:

```bash
# Option A: Environment variable
export CODEBUDDY_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

# Option B: In ~/.codebuddy/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CODEBUDDY_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

## Installation

> **Important**: Install either the English OR Chinese version — not both.

### Option 1: Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace (in CodeBuddy)
/plugin marketplace add jessepwj/CCteam-creator

# Step 2: Install — choose ONE language
/plugin install CCteam-creator@ccteam        # English
/plugin install CCteam-creator-cn@ccteam     # Chinese
```

### Option 2: Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jessepwj/CCteam-creator.git

# English
cp -r CCteam-creator/skills/CCteam-creator ~/.codebuddy/skills/CCteam-creator

# Or Chinese
cp -r CCteam-creator/cn/skills/CCteam-creator ~/.codebuddy/skills/CCteam-creator
```

### Option 3: Project-level Install

```bash
# Share with your team via project directory
cp -r CCteam-creator/skills/CCteam-creator .codebuddy/skills/CCteam-creator
```

## Usage

```
> Set up a team for my e-commerce project
> /CCteam-creator:setup
> Build a REST API with a team
```

> If installed manually, the command is `/CCteam-creator` instead of `/CCteam-creator:setup`.

**Trigger keywords**: `team`, `swarm`, `start project`, `set up project`, `create team`, `build team`, `multi-agent project`.

## Available Roles

| Role | Name | Model | Key Capabilities |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| Backend Dev | `backend-dev` | GLM-5.0 | Server code + TDD + Doc-Code Sync + observability (when applicable) |
| Frontend Dev | `frontend-dev` | GLM-5.0 | Client code + TDD + Doc-Code Sync + component testing |
| Researcher | `researcher` | GLM-5.0 | Code search + web research + plan stress-testing (read-only) |

You don't need all roles. CCteam-creator recommends the right combination for your project.

## Key Features

### Team-Lead as Control Plane

The main conversation acts as team-lead — not just a task dispatcher, but the **control plane** owning user alignment, phase gates, and the team's durable operating rules. Team-lead maintains the project CODEBUDDY.md (always in context), task_plan.md, and decisions.md.

### docs/ Knowledge Base (Harness Engineering)

Inspired by OpenAI's harness engineering approach, each project gets a structured `docs/` directory as the single source of truth:

```
.plans/<project>/docs/
  architecture.md     -- System architecture, components, data flow
  api-contracts.md    -- Frontend-backend API definitions (field-level specs)
  invariants.md       -- Unbreakable system boundaries (security, data isolation, contracts)
```

**Doc-Code Sync**: When code changes an API or architecture, devs MUST update the corresponding docs/ file. Reviewer checks this on every review. Undocumented APIs don't exist for other agents.

### Lean Navigation Map

task_plan.md is a **navigation map**, not an encyclopedia. Architecture, API specs, and tech stack details live in `docs/`. This keeps the main plan focused and prevents bloat — the plan stays readable even in large projects.

### Invariant-Driven Review

Recurring bug patterns are promoted from Known Pitfalls to formal invariants in `docs/invariants.md`. Reviewer checks code against invariants and recommends converting repeated patterns into automated tests. Goal: automated tests are the first line of defense, reviewer is the second.

### Failure-to-Guardrail Loop

When a 3-Strike escalation is resolved or a reviewer [BLOCK] is fixed, team-lead asks: "Will this recur?" If yes, it gets captured in CODEBUDDY.md's Known Pitfalls section — ensuring the same mistake never happens again. This is the core harness engineering insight: every failure becomes a permanent guardrail.

### Anti-Bloat Principles

Learned from real projects where files grew to 50,000+ tokens:
- **Root findings.md** is a pure index — no content dumping
- **progress.md** gets archived when it becomes too long to scan
- **task_plan.md** stays lean — details belong in docs/

### Requirements Alignment (Phase 0)

Before any development starts, the team performs structured requirements alignment:
- **Researcher** explores the existing codebase and documents architecture
- **Team-lead** aligns detailed requirements with the user
- Architecture decisions and scope are recorded in the plan before assigning dev tasks

### Vertical Slice Task Decomposition

Tasks are broken into **vertical slices** (tracer bullets), not horizontal layers. Each slice cuts through all layers end-to-end (schema → API → UI → tests) and is independently verifiable.

### TDD with Depth

Developers follow enhanced TDD:
- **Vertical slices**: one test → one implementation → repeat (never all tests first)
- **Behavior testing**: test WHAT the system does through public interfaces, not HOW
- **Mock boundaries**: only mock at system boundaries (external APIs, databases), never internal modules

### Architecture-Aware Code Review

The reviewer checks security/quality/performance, plus:
- **Doc-Code consistency** — API/architecture docs updated?
- **Invariant violations** — does the change break system boundaries?
- **Shallow module detection** — interface complexity ≈ implementation complexity
- **Test strategy** — "replace, don't layer" redundant tests

### Observability Support (When Applicable)

For web apps and services, devs are guided to emit structured events. E2E tester uses **event-first debugging**: query event logs first, browser console second, screenshots last. Insufficient observability is tagged `[OBSERVABILITY-GAP]` — a higher-priority finding than the bug itself.

### File-Based State Persistence

All progress persists to `.plans/<project>/`:

```
.plans/<project>/
  task_plan.md          -- Lean navigation map
  docs/                 -- Project knowledge base
    architecture.md / api-contracts.md / invariants.md
  archive/              -- Archived history

  backend-dev/
    findings.md         -- INDEX → task findings
    task-auth/
      task_plan.md / findings.md / progress.md

  researcher/
    findings.md         -- INDEX → research reports
    research-tech-stack/
      findings.md       -- Research report (main deliverable)

  reviewer/
    findings.md         -- INDEX → review reports
    review-auth-module/
      findings.md       -- Full review report
```

### Built-in Agent Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 2-Action Rule | Write findings after every 2 search operations |
| 3-Strike Escalation | Escalate after 3 failures, never silent retry |
| Guardrail Capture | Turn resolved failures into Known Pitfalls |
| Context Recovery | Progressive disclosure: docs/ → task files → progress |
| Periodic Self-Check | Verify alignment with plan every ~10 tool calls |
| Doc-Code Sync | Devs update docs/ when code changes; reviewer verifies |
| Phase Health Check | Verify doc freshness, stale tasks, index integrity at phase boundaries |

### Living CODEBUDDY.md

CODEBUDDY.md is not a one-time generation — it's a **living document** that evolves with the project. Updated when failure patterns are captured, team roster changes, or new protocols are established.

## Known Limitation: Teammate Context Cannot Be Compacted

With **200k context** (default), teammates auto-compact when context fills up — this works fine and requires no special handling.

With **1M context**, teammates **cannot auto-compact** and cannot run `/compact` manually. As context grows, performance degrades and costs increase significantly — yet the extra context often provides diminishing returns.

**Recommendation**: Use 200k context (default) for team projects. If you do use 1M context and notice slowdowns:

1. Exit CodeBuddy completely (`Ctrl+C` or `/exit`)
2. Resume with `codebuddy --continue`
3. Team-lead reads `.plans/` files to restore project state (CODEBUDDY.md is auto-loaded)
4. Re-spawn teammates — they start fresh with clean context and re-read their own `.plans/` files for recovery

This is a CodeBuddy platform limitation, not a CCteam-creator issue. All agent progress is persisted in `.plans/` files, so no work is lost on restart.
